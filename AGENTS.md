## Before writing new code

- Use Exa MCP tools to search for up-to-date documentation, code examples, and best practices:
    - `web_search_exa` — general search for docs and solutions
    - `get_code_context_exa` — find code examples from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and official docs
    - `company_research_exa` — research companies, their products, APIs, and services

## Continuity Ledger (compaction-safe)

Maintain a single Continuity Ledger for this workspace in `CONTINUITY.md`. The ledger is the
canonical session briefing designed to survive context compaction; do not rely on earlier chat text
unless it's reflected in the ledger.

### How it works

- At the start of every assistant turn: read `CONTINUITY.md`, update it to reflect the latest
  goal/constraints/decisions/state, then proceed with the work.
- Update `CONTINUITY.md` again whenever any of these change: goal, constraints/assumptions, key
  decisions, progress state (Done/Now/Next), or important tool outcomes.
- Keep it short and stable: facts only, no transcripts. Prefer bullets. Mark uncertainty as
  `UNCONFIRMED` (never guess).
- If you notice missing recall or a compaction/summary event: refresh/rebuild the ledger from
  visible context, mark gaps `UNCONFIRMED`, ask up to 1–3 targeted questions, then continue.

### `functions.update_plan` vs the Ledger

- `functions.update_plan` is for short-term execution scaffolding while you work (a small 3–7 step
  plan with pending/in_progress/completed).
- `CONTINUITY.md` is for long-running continuity across compaction (the "what/why/current state"),
  not a step-by-step task list.
- Keep them consistent: when the plan or state changes, update the ledger at the intent/progress
  level (not every micro-step).

### In replies

- Begin with a brief "Ledger Snapshot" (Goal + Now/Next + Open Questions). Print the full ledger
  only when it materially changes or when the user asks.

### `CONTINUITY.md` format (keep headings)

- Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Constraints/Assumptions:
- Key decisions:
- State:
    - Done:
    - Now:
    - Next:
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Working set (files/ids/commands):

After you’ve finished editing:

- Use the PHPStorm MCP (if available) to find any problems.
